# Traffic Volume Prediction

This project predicts traffic volume using machine learning models like Random Forest and Neural Networks. It generates synthetic traffic data, preprocesses it, and trains and evaluates models to predict traffic volume based on features like time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, and road type.

## Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generates a custom dataset for traffic volume prediction.
- **Preprocessing**: Handles categorical variables and scales features.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest Regressor and a Neural Network.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Visualization**: Plots actual vs predicted traffic volume for model performance analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
